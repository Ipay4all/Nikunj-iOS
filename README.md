# iOS-Developer-Coding-Challenge
As the next step in the interview process, we’d like you to complete a coding challenge.

## The Project

You will be building a beta version of a Virtual Product Management (VPM) APP. There's a postman collection in this repository, Access token is required to get product details based on the country UAE. You will need to take product data and persist it in a backend database. You will then develop a backend API, to be called upon by your frontend, which will display the data. This dashboard should allow registration and login of a user, requiring a password, and the user's credentials should also be persisted in your database.

The result should be a dashboard with two pages (the application can be single-page (SPA), or multiple pages):

* A registration/login page
* A main page that displays products with details well formatted 
* User should be able to add products, update details and delete products 

## Preparing Your Local Development Env

- Make sure you have [enabled signed commits with a GPG key](#signed-commits-with-gpg) on any machine you use during your submission. 
	- 100% signed commits are required for any submission to be evaluated.
- Check your local version of Xcode
	- The very **latest release version** of Xcode is required.
		- Beta versions of Xcode should **not** be used.
- Check your local swift version.
	- **Swift version 5.2 (or higher)** (installed with latest Xcode)
- Check your local swift-tools version.
	- **Swift-Tools version 5.2 (or higher)** is required
	- Install from [Swift.org](https://swift.org) if your local tools are not 5.2 or higher (should be by default when installing Xcode)
- The targeted iOS version for any submission should be **iOS 13.0**
	- In general, make sure to double check your project settings.
	- There is a starter project with some of this configured already, but you’ll need to make sure the final matches the requirements.


**Git**
* Maintain code on git (github/gitlab).
* Push code with proper commits.
* Create feature branch for each push (registration, dashboard).
* Create a conflict and resolve.
